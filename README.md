## Installing and deploying

### Prerequisites

* [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) and node version 8.
* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
* [AWS CLI](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html)
* BASH
* Docker (only required for testing)
* docker-compose (only required for testing `pip install docker-compose`)

Install the correct node version:

```
nvm install
nvm use
```

Ensure that the aws cli is configured and that the default output format is either JSON or None:

```
aws configure

```

### Install Lerna

We use Lerna to manage multiple Cumulus packages in the same repo. You need to install lerna as a global module first:

    $ yarn global add lerna

### Install Local Dependencies

We use yarn for local package management

    $ yarn install
    $ yarn ybootstrap

Building All packages:

    $ yarn build

Build and watch packages:

    $ yarn watch

## Running Tests

### LocalStack

[LocalStack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack) provides local versions of most AWS services for testing.

The LocalStack repository has [installation instructions](https://github.com/localstack/localstack#installing).

Localstack is included in the docker-compose file. You only need to run the docker-compose command in the next section in order to use it with your tests.

### Docker containers

Turn on the docker containers first:

    $ docker-compose up local

If you prefer to run docker in detached mode (i.e. run containers in the background), run:

    $ docker-compose up -d local

### Run tests

Run the test commands next

    $ export LOCALSTACK_HOST=localhost
    $ yarn test

Run end to end tests by

    $ yarn e2e

### Running integration tests on aws

- Run `./bin/prepare`
- Deploy your instance integrations on aws and run tests by following the steps [here](example/README.md)
    
### Running integration tests on CirlceCI

- Any commit message that includes the word `[run it]` or `[it run]` or `[it]` will trigger integration tests on circleci

### Code Coverage

Code coverage is checked using [nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc). The CircleCI build tests coverage. A summary can be viewed in the build output. Detailed code coverage in html can be found by going to the Artifacts tab and navigating to `index.html` in the coverage folder. Clicking on `index.html` will take you to an html page showing code coverage for each individual file.

The `yarn test` command will output code coverage data for the entire Cumulus repository. To create an html report, run `nyc report --reporter html` and open the `index.html` file in the coverage folder.

To run code coverage on an individual package during development, run `npm run test-coverage`. This will output the coverage in the terminal. An html report can be created using `nyc report --reporter html` as described above.

## Code quality checking

This project uses [eslint](https://eslint.org/) to check code style and quality.
The configured eslint rules can be found in the project's
[.eslintrc.json](https://github.com/nasa/cumulus/blob/master/.eslintrc.json)
file.

In an effort to gradually reduce the number of eslint errors in our codebase,
we are using a script called `eslint-ratchet`. It runs `eslint` against the
repo and compares the number of errors to the previous number of errors. The
previous number of errors is stored in the `.eslint-ratchet-high-water-mark`
file, and tracked in git. If the script is run and the number of errors has
been reduced, the new, lower score is stored in
`.eslint-ratchet-high-water-mark` and should be committed into git. If the
number of errors has increased, the script will fail and tell you that the
number of errors has increased.

To run the script, simply run `./bin/eslint-ratchet` from the top of the
cumulus repository.

The `eslint-ratchet` script is also part of our CircleCI build. If the number
of eslint errors that CircleCI finds has increased, it will fail the build. If
the number of errors has *decreased* from what is stored in
`.eslint-ratchet-high-water-mark`, it will also fail the build. In that case,
run `./bin/eslint-ratchet` and commit the new-and-improved
`.eslint-ratchet-high-water-mark` file.

To help prevent unexpected build failures in CircleCI, I suggest adding a
local post-commit hook that will run eslint-ratchet after every commit. This
will not cause your commits to fail if the score has increased, but it will
let you know that there is a problem. To set up the post-commit hook, create a
file called `.git/hooks/post-commit` which contains:

```
#!/bin/sh

set -e

echo "Running ./bin/eslint-ratchet"
./bin/eslint-ratchet
```

Make sure the hook is executable with `chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit`

This idea of ratcheting down the number of errors came from Vince Broz's
excellent [quality](https://github.com/apiology/quality) gem.

## Adding New Packages

Create a new folder under `packages` if it is a common library or create folder under `cumulus/tasks` if it is a lambda task. `cd` to the folder and run `npm init`.

Make sure to name the package as `@cumulus/package-name`.

## Versioning

We use a global versioning approach, meaning version numbers in cumulus are consistent across all packages and tasks, and semantic versioning to track major, minor, and patch version (i.e. 1.0.0). We use Lerna to manage our versioning. Any change will force lerna to increment the version of all packages.

Read more about the semantic versioning [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/semantic-versioning).

### Updating Cumulus version and publishing to NPM

All packages on master branch are automatically published to NPM.

Follow the following steps to publish to NPM:

#### 1. Create the release branch

Create a new branch from `master` (make sure you have latest) and call it `release-version-<version_number>`. 

Release PRs **MUST** be named with `release-` prefix. This will kick off the AWS integration tests in the CI process and ensures that package updates are fully tested on AWS before publication to NPM.

#### 2. Update the Cumulus Version number

When changes are ready to be released, the Cumulus version number must be updated using semantic versioning.

Lerna handles the process of deciding which version number should be used as long as the developer decides whether the change is a patch or a minor/major change.

To update cumulus' version number run:

     $ yarn update

You will be prompted to select the type of change (patch/minor/major). Lerna will update the version of all packages after the selection.

#### 3. Update the Changelog

Update the CHANGELOG.md. Put a header under the 'Unreleased' section with the new version number and the date.

Add a link reference for the github "compare" view at the bottom of the CHANGELOG.md, following the existing pattern. This link reference should create a link in the CHANGELOG's release header to changes in the corresponding release.

#### 4. Update the example package.json

Update example/package.json to point to the new Cumulus packages.

#### 5. Create a git tag

The CHANGELOG changes and package updates should be pushed to git. Then tag the release. The tag is what tells npm what to publish, so it is important for this branch to be up to date with master and have all these changes pushed.

Create a new git tag

  $ git tag -a v1.x.x -m "version 1.x.x release"

Push the tag to github

  $ git push origin v1.x.x

#### 6. PR and merge to master

Create a PR against the `master` branch

After the PR is merged, update the (tag) and give a proper title and copy the release details from the CHANGELOG.md to the release

### Backporting to a previous release

To backport and release to an earlier minor version of Cumulus than the latest minor version, follow the below steps. For example if the current version is 1.6 and a fix needs to be backported to 1.5.

#### 1. Create a version branch

If a version branch does not exist, it must be created. Sync to the tag for the latest patch version in the minor version.

    $ git checkout v1.5.5
    
Create a branch for version 1.5.

    $ git checkout -b v1.5
   
Push the branch to git.

#### 2. Make changes and PR

Create a release branch off the version branch (i.e. v1.5) to create a branch for the changes. Use git cherry-pick or manually make the changes.

Follow [step 2](#2-update-the-cumulus-version-number) above to update the version number using `yarn update`.

Create a pull request against the version branch.

#### 3. Create a git tag

When the PR is approved and changes are finalized, follow [these steps](#5-create-a-git-tag). At this point, merges to master should be held off until the changes are released. If someone merges to master, master will pick up the new git tag and publish this release, tagging it as latest, meaning anyone who performs an `npm install` will get this patch version and not the actual latest version.

#### 4. Merge to the version branch

Merging to a branch structured as vX.Y will kick off the release and npm testing process. The version will be published to npm not as latest, but with a tag `patch-vX.Y.Z`.

Verify that the changes were released with the correct tag in npm.

#### 5. Update the Changelog

In master, update the changelog for the release, making sure a link is put in the bottom. 

## Running command in all package folders
